# ⚡ VoltScript

**The Electrical Language for Embedded Minds**  

VoltScript is an experimental open-source programming language (DSL) designed for **electrical engineers, students, and makers** who want to write simple, readable code for development boards like **ESP32, STM32, and Raspberry Pi Pico** — without diving into low-level boilerplate.  

VoltScript makes embedded programming feel like writing electrical logic instead of wiring complex code.
